# Make-your-own-Pulse-Oximeter

This is a step by step guide to creating your own pulse oximeter using the Teensy LC and MAX30100 breakout board. 


# Components
Order the components listed on the parts list. 
 - The breakout breadboard and header pins are not required however these components help simplify assembly. 
 - Any OLED screen will work provided it can be controlled using SPI
 - It should be noted this circuit has been proven to work with an Arduino Uno and any other Teensy boards. 

 Misc. Components and Tools Required
  - Wire
  - Soldering Iron
  - Screw Driver set
  - Hand saw
  - Female jumper cables
  
# Assembly
1. 3D print the STL files included in repository. Casing is not required for circuit function.
2. Test electrical components on a breadboard using the circuit diagram provided. 
 - Install required Arduino libraries listed under Code heading
 - Test function of circuit
3. Solder components using breakout breadboard or wire. See attached image "Soldered Circuit"
 - Note I resized the breakout boared using a small handsaw to ensure it fits in the enclosure. This is not necessary if you wire directly to the teensy boared.
